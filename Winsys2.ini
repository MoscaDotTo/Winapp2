Q&A

1.)
Q: Where you can download CCleaner?
A: You can download it at www.piriform.com

2.)
Q: What is Winapp2?
A: It's a custom api for Windows (=Therefore Win-app), where you can add your own rules.
   But some members have made a file called "Winapp2.ini", which has got a lot of more than 
   a single man could ever add.

3.)
Q: Where can I download Winapp2.ini?
A: You can download it at www.winapp2.com

4.)
Q: How can unistall Winapp2.ini?
A: You just have to delete your Winapp2.ini file in (ProgramFiles (x86) or ProgramFiles\CCleaner) Folder.

5.)
Q: How can I make it faster to work and why it is so slow?
A: You can download Trim.bat on Winapp2.com. This is slow, because the whole HDD has to be scanned for the existence
   of the installed programs. This will be very slow if there are a lot of entrys and you have a slow PC.

6.)
Q: Does this exist for Mac too?
A: To be sadly say, NO. If you can help, you can do so by making entries for Winapp2.ini.
But Ccleaner doesn't support this kind of entries for Mac as far we know.	

7.)
Q: Can all of this be done easier?
A: Yes, you can download the Tool "CCEnhancer" by Singularlabs, which can download Winapp2.ini and Trim it for you.

8.)
Q: Can you use Winapp2.ini for the portable CCleaner and is there a portable Version of CCleaner?
A: You can download the portable version in the official website. Yes you can use it with just placing the file into the folder.

9.)
Q: Can I help this project to improve?
A: Yes you can do it. You could make entries or if you are not very good at that, then at least you could add
   [Useless Files 2.2] entry (you find in this file) to your Winapp2.ini and scan for useless files and send them to us. 
   But please clean your PC with CCleaner and Winapp2.ini the newest of Both and the you can scan.
   After that, it would be good to have a dump of your registry, but as this is problematic (A lot of
   Software stores his password in the registry.), this is not possible. If you find a Useless Files,
   please store them in this file and send to the Winapp2.ini Forum, so we could add them.

Helpful Tips for Users:

Tip-1:

;    Extra for forum users; Add this to regedit
;     
;    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Dfrg\BootOptimizeFunction]
;    "Enable"="Y"
;    "LcnStartLocation"="0"
;    "LcnEndLocation"="0"
;     
;    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\PrefetchParameters]
;    "EnablePrefetcher"=dword:00000003
;
;    Then run this command on cmd
;
;    Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks
;
;    Wait for the message and ur done

;    THX, Neverbloom 

Tip-2:
;     
;     Go to this Folder:
;     C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application
      And delete the old application folder with the older number:

;      C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\35.0.1916.114
;      C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\37.0.2062.120
;      (In this folder are the old application files, which are just deleteable with script.
;      CCleaner does not support this right now, perhaps in the future.)


Tip-3:
    
;     You can find errors in your Winapp2.ini files with following methods:
;     Search for impossibilities, which aren't used in Winapp2.ini:
      "**"
      "//"

      "=="
      "\\"

Tip-4:
;     
      Avoid Constructions like this:
      "\|", just use "|", so you save space.

Tip-5: 

      You can go to DEBUG Mode with following CMD code:
      "C:\Program Files\CCleaner\CCleaner64.exe /debug"
      "C:\Program Files\CCleaner\CCleaner.exe /debug"

Tip-6:

Ccleaner is able to delete the no longer used *.torrent files from the folder "C:\Documents and
Settings\USER\Application Data\uTorrent"? No, because there is no lock and it deletes all files.

Tip-7:

Printer Queue List Clearing
"
net stop spooler
RD /S %WinDir%\System32\spool\Printers
net start spooler
"

a.) Unchecky:
----------------------------------------------------------
This Software is very good for people installing a lot

at.) uniextractor:

doable by android and Ios and windows as far as I know is
not supporting it up today.

have to click one button for optimizing the software.

bc.) Trim.bat:
----------------------------------------------------------
This is very helpful for using Winapp2.ini, which is trimming
the Winapp2.ini to the entrys, which are on the pc. So 
Ccleaner will work much more faster on your pc, because it
will check for less entries.

bd.) NVIDIA Phxsy:
----------------------------------------------------------

problematic for you and not installing could be problematic.

bg.) Windows 10 over Windows 7 over Windows XP over Windows 8 
     over Windows Vista
----------------------------------------------------------
The best Windows to this time is Win10 and then Win7 and and
then the unsupported Winxp and the starmenuless win8 and the
worst OS ever in the world: Windows Vista...Please don't install
it, because it will just be a buggy and will be slow. All is
better, than Vista.

bh.) Android over IOS:
----------------------------------------------------------
Android supports all kind of things and much more and the
smartphones, which are android suported, use the same charger
and more. IOS will prevent you from doing everything you can
actually imagine and is arrogant trademark ever. If you want
problems, than you can use IOS, while in android you can 
customize it will a lot of tools, without to root it. You can
copy the files you need with bluetooth and just with a usb cable,
but in Iphone this is not supported for all kind of files and 
without Itunes you are not able to do anything as far as I know.
And developer had certain, because they cannot access all apis they
want. The only good thing is the backup of ICLOUD, but Google
will support it hopefully soon.
