# Winapp2
A database of extended cleaning routines for popular Windows PC based maintenance software. 

There are two Winapp2 files published here. One is for CCleaner use, which is modified to remove entries because they were added in CCleaner. The other one is for BleachBit, System Ninja, and Avira System Speedup, which contains all entries, even the removed ones, which is located in the Non-CCleaner folder. Please use the proper one for your cleaner to avoid any issues happening.

How to use Winapp2 for the following cleaners:

- For CCleaner users, download the latest copy of Winapp2. Move the copy to your CCleaner directory. Then run Trim.bat that is located here: http://www.winapp2.com/downloads.html  Follow the guide on how to use Trim.bat here: http://www.winapp2.com/howto.html

Alternatively, CCleaner users can also use CCenhancer to update and trim Winapp2: https://singularlabs.com/software/ccenhancer/

- For BleachBit users, open up BleachBit, click on "Edit" tab, then click on "Preferences". Make sure "Download and update cleaners from community (winapp2.ini)" is checked.

- For System Ninja users, you should already have a copy installed in the System Ninja/scripts directory. If not, you can always put a up-to-date one there yourself.

- For Avira System Speedup users, go to Settings - Device Optimizer and check "Scan using Winapp2 rules".
